                    <h2>SHORT SUMMARY</h2>
                    <p>The story is set in Alsace, France, during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), when Prussia
                        defeated France and took over Alsace and Lorraine. The narrator, Franz, is a young schoolboy who
                        dreads school and dislikes learning French. One day, he arrives late to school and notices an
                        unusual silence. His teacher, M. Hamel, announces that this is their last French lesson because
                        a new order has come from Berlin: only German will be taught in schools. Franz regrets not
                        paying attention in class earlier. M. Hamel delivers an emotional speech about the importance of
                        language and how it is the key to a nation's identity and freedom. The villagers, including old
                        Hauser, attend the class as a mark of respect. The lesson ends with M. Hamel writing "Vive La
                        France!" on the board, overwhelmed with emotion.</p>
